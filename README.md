**Beelivery** is a hyper-local food delivery service designed from the ground up to solve the unique logistical challenges at the **Binus University @ Alam Sutera campus**. This project is the live Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for our "Entrepreneurship: Market Validation" course.

## The Problem: A Race Against the Clock 😫

The Binus @ Alam Sutera campus is a 20-floor vertical world. For thousands of students and staff, a short break between classes turns into a stressful race.

* **⏳ The 20-Minute Break:** It's barely enough time to get to the canteen and back.
* ** elevators:** Crowded elevators mean long, frustrating waits.
* **🏃‍♂️ The Long Walk & Queue:** The canteens are far from the main tower, and the lines are even longer.

The result? Students and staff are forced to choose between being on time for class and getting a proper meal. This leads to skipped lunches, stress, and reduced focus.

## Our Solution: Reclaim Your Break ✨

**Beelivery** is a web-based platform that gives Binusians back their break time.

Order from any on-campus canteen through our simple web app, and one of our on-site student runners will navigate the building's layout with maximum efficiency to deliver it directly to your classroom or desk.

We offer a **fast, affordable, and reliable** service that lets you relax, eat, and be ready for your next class without the rush.

## 🛠️ Our Lean Tech Stack

This MVP is built to be efficient, scalable, and extremely low-cost, using a modern serverless architecture.

* **🌐 Frontend:** A responsive, mobile-first web app built with vanilla **HTML, CSS, & JavaScript**.
* **🤖 Backend:** A robust backend powered by **Google Apps Script**, which handles all order processing, menu fetching, and notifications.
* **📊 Database:** **Google Sheets** serves as our simple, effective, and free database for both menu items and incoming orders.
* **💬 Team Operations:** Real-time order dispatching and coordination are managed via instant, automated notifications to a private **Discord** server.

## How It Works: The Beelivery Flow 🚀

1.  **📱 Browse & Select:** Access our web app via a QR code and browse the menus of campus canteens.
2.  **🛒 Add to Cart:** Add up to 3 items to your multi-vendor cart and choose your preferred delivery speed.
3.  **💳 Submit & Pay:** Fill in your details (name, location) and submit the order.
4.  **⚡ Automated Dispatch:** Our script instantly logs the order in our Google Sheet and sends a "New Order" alert to the Beelivery team's Discord.
5.  **🐝 Fast Delivery:** An available runner claims the job, picks up the food, and delivers it directly to you.
